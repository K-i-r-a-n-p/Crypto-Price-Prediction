The cryptocurrency price prediction project aimed to forecast the future prices of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum using machine learning models. By analyzing historical data that included features such as open, close, high, low prices, and trading volumes, various machine learning algorithms—Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Stochastic Gradient Descent—were trained and evaluated. The models were compared using performance metrics like R2 score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to determine their accuracy. The project demonstrated that certain models, such as Random Forest and Linear Regression, could effectively predict cryptocurrency prices, helping investors make better decisions and manage risk.
